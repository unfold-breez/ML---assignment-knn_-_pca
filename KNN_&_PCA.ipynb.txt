        "\n",
        "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** is a **non-parametric, instance-based machine learning algorithm** that can be used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It makes predictions based on the similarity between a new data point and the points in the training dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **How KNN Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Store the training data**\n",
        "   KNN is **lazy learning**, meaning it doesn’t build an explicit model. It just stores the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Compute distance to neighbors**\n",
        "   When making a prediction for a new input, KNN calculates the distance between the new point and all training points.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Common distance metrics: **Euclidean**, **Manhattan**, or **Minkowski distance**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Select K nearest neighbors**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Choose the **K closest points** from the training data based on the distance metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Predict output**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **Classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Count the classes of the K neighbors.\n",
        "     * Assign the class that occurs most frequently (majority voting).\n",
        "     * Example: If 3 neighbors are \"A\" and 2 are \"B\", predict \"A\".\n",
        "   * **Regression:**\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Take the **average (or weighted average)** of the K neighbors’ target values.\n",
        "     * Example: If neighbors’ values are 10, 12, 15 → predict `(10+12+15)/3 = 12.33`.\n",

        "\n",
        "  * Small K → sensitive to noise (high variance).\n",
        "  * Large K → smoother predictions but may miss local patterns (high bias).\n",
        "* **Feature scaling matters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * KNN is distance-based, so features should often be normalized or standardized.\n",
        "* **Non-parametric:**\n",

        "\n",
        "The **Curse of Dimensionality** refers to the problems that arise when working with **high-dimensional data**—i.e., datasets with a very large number of features. It particularly affects algorithms like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** that rely on distance metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Why it Happens**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. In high-dimensional space, the volume of the feature space grows exponentially.\n",
        "2. Data points become **sparse**, and the concept of “nearest neighbors” becomes less meaningful.\n",
        "3. The difference in distance between the nearest and farthest points shrinks, making it hard for KNN to distinguish close points from distant ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Effects on KNN Performance**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Distance metrics lose significance**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * KNN relies on distances (e.g., Euclidean) to find neighbors.\n",
        "   * In high dimensions, all points tend to have similar distances from each other, so KNN struggles to identify truly “nearest” neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Increased overfitting**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * With many dimensions, KNN may pick neighbors that are not truly similar in a meaningful way, leading to noisy predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Higher computational cost**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Distance calculations increase linearly with the number of features, slowing down predictions.\n",
